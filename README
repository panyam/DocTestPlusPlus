What is DocTest++?
------------------

Python allows doctests - tests that can be embedded within the documentation of a
function.  This has the advantage of seeing all the test case associated
with a bit of code right then and there.  

DocTest++ bring this functionality to C/C++ code.  Working in conjunction
with UnitTest++, DocTest++ extracts fragments from the documentation in a
header and source files and generates UnitTest++ specific test cases for
them.

Syntax
------

Tests must be within multiline comments.  Comments can be anywhere.  The
tests must be enclosed with @test and @endtest tags.  The contents between
the @test and @endtest tags are used verbatim as the contents of the
generated test blocks.

For example:

/**
 * Adds two numbers.
 *
 * @test(TestAddition)
 *  CHECK(3, add2(1, 2));
 * @endtest
 */
int add2(int a, int b) { return a + b; }

would generate the following test code in UnitTest++.

TEST(TestAddition)
{
    CHECK(3, add2(1, 2));
}

Clearly the "@endtest" tag is the token that ends the test.  To include an
"@endtest" simply prefix the @endtask with an "@".  So the following code:

/**
 * Adds two numbers.
 *
 * @test(TestAddition)
 *  CHECK(3, add2(1, 2));
 *  printf("Our End Tag is @@endtest");
 * @endtest
 */
int add2(int a, int b) { return a + b; }

would generate:

TEST(TestAddition)
{
    CHECK(3, add2(1, 2));
    printf("Our End Tag is @endtest");
}

Test Configuration
------------------

The @test tag can also take parameters.  The first parameter is the name of
the text.  So far the following options are available (for now):
    suite   -   The Suite in which the tests will be generated.
    fixture -   The fixture to which the test belongs.

So the following snippet:

/**
 * Adds two numbers.
 *
 * @test(TestAddition, fixture = "NumericFixture",
 *                     suite = "NumberTests")
 *  CHECK(3, add2(1, 2));
 *  printf("Our End Tag is @@endtest");
 * @endtest
 */
int add2(int a, int b) { return a + b; }

would generate:

SUITE(NumberTests)
{
TEST_FIXTURE(NumericFixture, TestAddition)
{
    CHECK(3, add2(1, 2));
    printf("Our End Tag is @endtest");
}
}
